<b>
I wandered today to the hill, Maggie<br>
To watch the scene below<br>
The creek and the rusty old mill, Maggie<br>
Where we sat in the long, long ago.<br>
The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie<br>
Where first the daisies sprung<br>
The old rusty mill is still, Maggie<br>
Since you and I were young.<p>

A city so silent and lone, Maggie<br>
Where the young and the gay and the best<br>
In polished white mansion of stone, Maggie<br>
Have each found a place of rest<br>
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie<br>
And join in the songs that were sung<br>
For we sang just as gay as they, Maggie<br>
When you and I were young.<p>

They say I am feeble with age, Maggie<br>
My steps are less sprightly than then<br>
My face is a well written page, Maggie<br>
But time alone was the pen.<br>
They say we are aged and grey, Maggie<br>
As spray by the white breakers flung<br>
But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie<br>
When you and I were young.<p>

And now we are aged and grey, Maggie<br>
The trials of life nearly done<br>
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie<br>
When you and I were young.
