<b>
When Johnny comes marching home again, Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
We'll give him a hearty welcome then, Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
The men will cheer, the boys will shout<br>
The ladies they will all turn out<br>
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.<p>

The old Church bell will peal with joy, Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
To welcome home out darling boy, Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
The village lads and lassies gay<br>
With roses they will strew the way<br>
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.<p>

Get ready for the jubilee, Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
We'll give the heroes three times three, Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
The laurel wreath is ready now<br>
To place upon his loyal brow<br>
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.<p>
