<b>
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord<br>
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored<br>
He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword<br>
His truth is marching on.<p>

<i>Chorus<br> 
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br>
His truth is marching on.</i><p>

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps<br>
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps<br>
l can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps<br>
His day is marching on.<p>

I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish'd rows of steel,<br>
"As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal."<br>
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel<br>
Since God is marching on.<p>

He has sounded form the trumpet that shall never call retreat<br>
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat<br>
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant, my feet!<br>
Our God is marching on.<p>

He has sounded from the trumpet that shall never call retreat<br>
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat<br>
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant, my feet!<br>
Our God is marching on.<p>

ln the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,<br>
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me.<br>
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,<br>
While God is marching on.
