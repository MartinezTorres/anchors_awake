<center><h2>Lost Jimmy Whelan</h2></center>
<b>
All alone as I strayed by the banks of the river<br>
Watching the moonbeams as evening drew nigh<br>
All alone as I rambled, I spied a fair damsel<br>
Weeping and wailing with many a sigh.<br>
<br>
Weeping for one who is now lying lowly<br>
Mourning for one who no mortal can save<br>
As the foaming dark water flow gently about him<br>
Onward they speed over young Jimmy's grave.<br>
<br>
She cries, "Oh, my darling, please come to me quickly<br>
And give me fond kisses that oft-times you gave<br>
You promised to meet me this evening, my darling<br>
So now, lovely Jimmy, arise from your grave."<p>

Slowly he rose from the dark, stormy waters<br>
A vision of beauty more fair than the sun<br>
Saying "I have returned from the regions of glory<br>
To be in your dear loving arms once again."<p>

"Oh, Jimmy, why can't you tarry here with me<br>
Not leave me alone, so distracted in pain."<br>
"Since death is the dagger that's cut us asunder<br>
Wide is the gulf, love, between you and I."<p>

"One fond embrace, love, and then I must leave you<br>
One loving farewell, and then we must part."<br>
Cold were the arms that encircled about her<br>
Cold was the body she pressed to her heart.<p>

Slowly he rose from the banks of the river<br>
Up to the heavens he then seemed to go<br>
Leaving this fair maiden, weeping and mourning<br>
Alone on the banks of the river below.
