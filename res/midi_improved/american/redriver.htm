<b>
From this valley they say you are going<br>
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile<br>
For they say you are taking the sunshine<br>
That has brightened our path for a while.<p>

Come and sit by my side if you love me<br>
Do not hasten to bid me adieu<br>
But remember the Red River Valley<br>
And the cowboy who loved you so true.<p>

Won't you think of the valley you're leaving<br>
Oh how lonely, how sad it will be?<br>
Oh think of the fond heart you're breaking<br>
And the grief you are causing to me.<p>

As you go to your home by the ocean<br>
May you never forget those sweet hours<br>
That we spent in the Red River Valley<br>
And the love we exchanged mid the flowers.
