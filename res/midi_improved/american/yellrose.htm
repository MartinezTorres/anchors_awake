<b>
There's a yellow rose of Texas<br>
That I am going to see<br>
No other fellow knows her<br>
No other, only me.<br>
She cried so when I left her<br>
It like to break my heart<br>
And if I ever find her<br>
We never more will part.<p>

She's the sweetest rose of color<br>
A fellow ever knew<br>
Her eyes are bright as diamonds<br>
They sparkle like the dew.<br>
You may talk about your dearest May<br>
And sing of Rosa Lee<br>
But the Yellow Rose of Texas<br>
Beats the belles of Tennessee.<p>

Oh, now I'm going to find her<br>
For my heart is full of woe<br>
And we'll sing the song together<br>
That we sung long ago<br>
We'll play the banjo gaily<br>
And we'll sing the songs of yore<br>
And the Yellow Rose of Texas<br>
Shall be mine forevermore.
