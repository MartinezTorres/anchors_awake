<b>
Come all ye fair and tender ladies<br>
Take warning how you court young men<br>
They're like a bright star on a cloudy morning<br>
They will first appear and then they're gone.<p>

They'll tell to you some loving story<br>
To make you think that they love you true<br>
Straightway they'll go and court some other<br>
Oh that's the love that they have for you.<p>

I wish I were some little sparrow<br>
And I had wings and I could fly<br>
I would fly away to my false true lover<br>
And while he'll talk I would sit and cry.<p>

But I am not some little sparrow<br>
I have no wings nor can I fly<br>
So I'll sit down here in grief and sorrow<br>
And try to pass my troubles by.<p>

I wish I had known before I courted<br>
That love had been so hard to gain<br>
I'd of locked my heart in a box of golden<br>
And fastened it down with a silver chain.<p>

Young men never cast your eye on beauty<br>
For beauty is a thing that will decay<br>
For the prettiest flowers that grow in the garden<br>
How soon they'll wither, will wither and fade away.
