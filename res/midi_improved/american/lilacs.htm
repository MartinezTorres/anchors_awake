<b>
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew<br>
I'm lonely my darling since parting with you<br>
But by our next meeting I hope to prove true<br>
And change the green lilacs to the red, white and blue.<p>

I had a sweetheart but now I have none<br>
Since she's gone and left me, I care not for one<br>
Since she's gone and left me, contented I'll be<br>
For she loves another one better than me.<p>

I wrote love letters in rosy red lines<br>
She sent me an answer all twisted in twines<br>
Saying, "Keep your love letters and I will keep mine<br>
Just you write to your love and I'll write to mine!"<p>
