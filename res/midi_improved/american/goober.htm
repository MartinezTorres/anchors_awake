<center><h2>Goober Peas</h2></center>
<b>
Sitting by the roadside on a summer's day<br>
Chatting with my mess-mates passing time away<br>
Lying in the shadows underneath the trees<br>
Goodness how delicious eating goober peas.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
Peas, peas, peas, peas<br>
Eating goober peas<br>
Goodness how delicious<br>
Eating goober peas.</i><p>

When a horse-man passes, the soldiers have a rule<br>
To cry out their loudest, "Mister, here's your mule?"<br>
But another custom, enchanting-er than these<br>
Is wearing out your grinders, eating goober peas.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

Just before the battle, the General hears a row<br>
He says "The Yanks are coming, I hear their rifles now."<br>
He looks down the roadway and what d'you think he sees?<br>
The Georgia Militia cracking goober peas.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

I think my song has lasted just about enough.<br>
The subject's interesting but the rhymes are mighty rough.<br>
I wish the war was over so free from rags and fleas<br>
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts, say good-bye to goober peas.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>
