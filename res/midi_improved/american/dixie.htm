<b>
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton<br>
Old times there are not forgotten<br>
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.<br>
In Dixie Land where I was born in<br>
Early on one frosty mornin'<br>
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.<p>

<i>
Chorus<br>
Oh, I wish I was in Dixie! Hooray! Hooray!<br>
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand<br>
To live and die in Dixie<br>
Away, away, away down south in Dixie<br>
Away, away, away down south in Dixie!<p>
</i>

Old Missus marry Will, the weaver,<br>
William was a gay deceiver<br>
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.<br>
But when he put his arm around her<br>
He smiled as fierce as a forty pounder<br>
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.<p>

His face was sharp as a butcher's cleaver<br>
But that did not seem to grieve her<br>
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.<br>
Old Missus acted the foolish part<br>
And died for a man that broke her heart<br>
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.
