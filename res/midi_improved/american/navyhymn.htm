<b>
Eternal Father, strong to save<br>
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave<br>
Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep<br>
Its own appointed limits keep:<br>
O hear us when we cry to thee<br>
For those in peril on the sea.<p>

O Christ, whose voice the waters heard,<br>
And hushed their raging at thy word<br>
Who walkedst on the foaming deep<br>
And calm amid the storm didst sleep:<br>
O hear us when we cry to thee<br>
For those in peril on the sea.<p>

O Holy Spirit, who didst brood<br>
Upon the chaos dark and rude<br>
And bid the angry tumult cease<br>
And give for wild confusion peace:<br>
O hear us when we cry to thee<br>
For those in peril on the sea.<p>

O trinity of love and power<br>
Our brethren shield in danger's hour.<br>
From rock and tempest, fire and foe<br>
Protect them wheresoe'er they go:<br>
O hear us when we cry to thee<br>
For those in peril on the sea.
