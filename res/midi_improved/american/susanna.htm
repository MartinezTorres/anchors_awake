<b>
I came from Alabama wid my banjo on my knee<br>
I'm goin' to Lousiana, my true love for to see<br>
It rained all night de day I left, de weather it was dry<br>
De sun so hot I froze to death, Susanna don't you cry.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
Oh! Susanna, oh don't you cry for me<br>
For I'm goin' to Lousiana wid my banjo on my knee.</i><p>

I had a dream de odder night, when ev'ry thing was still<br>
I thought I saw Susanna a-comin' down de hill<br>
De buckwheat cake was in her mouth, de tear was in her eye<br>
Says I, I'm comin' from de South, Susanna don't you cry.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

I soon will be in New Orleans, and den I'll look all 'round<br>
And when I find Susanna I'll fall upon de ground<br>
But if I do not find her, dis darkie'll surely die<br>
And when I'm dead and buried, Susanna don't your cry.<p>

<i>Chorus</i>
