<b>
Oh, I'm a good old Rebel<br>
Now that's just what I am<br>
For this fair land of freedom<br>
I do not care a damn.<br>
I'm glad I fit against it<br>
I only wish we'd won.<br>
And I don't want no pardon<br>
For anything I've done.<p>

I hates the Constitution<br>
This great Republic too <br>
I hates the Freedmen's Buro<br>
In uniforms of blue.<br>
I hates the nasty eagle<br>
With all his brag and fuss<br>
But the lyin', thievin' Yankees<br>
I hates' em wuss and wuss.<p>

Three hundred thousand Yankees<br>
Lies still in Southern dust<br>
We got three hundred thousand<br>
Before they conquered us<br>
They died of Southern fever<br>
And Southern steel and shot<br>
I wish they was three million<br>
Instead of what we got.<p>

I can't take up my musket<br>
And fight' em now no mo'<br>
But I ain't a-goin'to love' em<br>
Now that is sartin sho'<br>
And I don't want no pardon<br>
For what I was and am<br>
And I won't be reconstructed<br>
And I do not give a damn.
