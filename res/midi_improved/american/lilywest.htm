<b>
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find<br>
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind<br>
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast<br>
And the name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.<p>

I courted lovely Flora, some pleasure there to find<br>
But she turned unto another man, which sore distressed my mind<br>
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest<br>
Then go my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.<p>

Way down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree<br>
Conversing with my Flora there, it seemed so strange to me<br>
And the answer that she gave to him, it sore did me oppress<br>
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.<p>

I stepped up to my rival, my dagger in my hand<br>
I seized him by the collar and I boldly bade him stand<br>
Being mad to desperation I pierced him in the breast<br>
Then go my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.<p>

I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea<br>
They placed me in the criminal box and then commenced on me<br>
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest<br>
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
