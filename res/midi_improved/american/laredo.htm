<center><h2>The Cowboy's Lament</h2></center>
<b>
As I walked out in the streets of Laredo<br>
As I walked out in Laredo one day<br>
I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen<br>
Wrapped up in white linen and cold as the clay.<p>

"I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy"<br>
These words he did say as I boldly stepped by<br>
"Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story<br>
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die."<p>

"Oh beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly<br>
Play the Dead March as you carry me along<br>
Take me to the green valley and lay the sod o'er me<br>
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong."<p>

"It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing<br>
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay<br>
First to the dram house and then to the card house<br>
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today."<p>

"Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin<br>
Get six pretty maidens to bear up my pall<br>
Put branches of roses all over my coffin<br>
Put roses to deaden the clods as they fall."<p>

"Go bring me a cup, a cup of cold water<br>
To cool my parched lips," the young cowboy said<br>
Before I returned, the spirit had left him<br>
And gone to its Maker, the cowboy was dead.<p>

We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly<br>
And bitterly wept as we bore him along<br>
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young and handsome<br>
We all loved our comrade, although he'd done wrong.
