<b>
Tenbrooks was a bay horse, had a long, shaggy mane<br>
Rode all around Memphis, beat the big Memphis train<br>
Run, Tenbrooks, run, 'cause if you don't run<br>
Molly's gonna beat you to the bright shinin' sun.<br>
Bright shinin' sun.<p>

The women were weepin', their babes cryin' too<br>
The nine proud horses came thunderin' through<br>
With Molly the leader, her head tossin' high<br>
With Molly the leader, and Tenbrooks behind<br>
She came flyin' by.<p>

We shouted to Kuyper, you're not ridin' right<br>
Molly is a beatin' Tenbrooks out of sight<br>
Kuyper, oh Kuyper, Kuyper my son<br>
Give him the bridle, and let Tenbrooks run.<br>
Let Tenbrooks run.<p>

Tenbrooks looked at Molly, "Your face is so red<br>
Been runnin in the hot sun with a feverish head<br>
You're fallin' behind me, I'm out here all alone."<br>
Molly says to Tenbrooks, "I'm leavin' this world<br>
I'm goin' on home."<p>

Oh, run fetch old Tenbrooks and tie him in the shade<br>
They're buryin' Molly in a coffin ready made<br>
Out in California Molly done as she pleased,<br>
Back in Kentucky, got beat with all ease<br>
Got beat with all ease.
