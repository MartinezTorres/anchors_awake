<b>
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound<br>
That saved a wretch like me<br>
I once was lost, but now I'm found<br>
Was blind, but now I see.<p>

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear<br>
And grace that fear relieved<br>
How precious did that grace appear<br>
The hour I first believed.<p>

Through many dangers, toils, and snares<br>
I have already come<br>
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far<br>
And grace will lead me home.<p>

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds<br>
In a believer's ear<br>
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds<br>
And drives away his fear.<p>

Must Jesus bear the cross alone<br>
And all the world go free<br>
No, there's a cross for everyone<br>
And there's a cross for me.<p>

When we've been here ten thousand years<br>
Bright shining as the sun<br>
We've no less days to sing God's praise<br>
Than when we first begun.
