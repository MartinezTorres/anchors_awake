<b>
Let tyrants shake their iron rod<br>
And slavery clank galling chain<br>
We'll fear them not; we trust in God<br>
New England's God forever reigns.<p>

When God inspired us for the fight<br>
Their ranks were broke; their lines were forced<br>
Their ships were shattered in our sight<br>
Or swiftly driven from our shore.<p>

The foe comes on with haughty stride<br>
Our troops advance with martial noise<br>
Their veterans flee before our youth<br>
And generals yield to beardless boys.
