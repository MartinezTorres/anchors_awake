<b>
I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair<br>
Borne like a vapor on the summer air<br>
I see her tripping where the bright streams play<br>
Happy as the daisies that dance on her way.<br>
Many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour,<br>
Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er.<br>
I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair<br>
Floating like a vapor on the soft, summer air.<p>

I sigh for Jeannie, but her light form strayed<br>
Far from the fond parts round her native glade;<br>
Her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown<br>
Flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone.<br>
Now the nodding wild flow'rs may wither on the shore,<br>
While her gentle fingers will cull them no more;<br>
I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair<br>
Floating like a vapor on the soft, summer air.<p>
