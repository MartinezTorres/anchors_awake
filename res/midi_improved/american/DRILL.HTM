<b>
Every morning about seven o'clock<br>
There were twenty tarriers drilling at the rock<br>
The boss comes along and he says, "Keep still<br>
And bear down heavy on the cast iron drill."<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
And drill, ye tarriers, drill<br>
Drill, ye tarriers, drill<br>
For it's work all day for the sugar in you tay<br>
Down beyond the railway<br>
And drill, ye tarriers, drill<br>
And blast, and fire.</i><p>

The boss was a fine man down to the ground<br>
And he married a lady six feet 'round<br>
She baked good bread and she baked it well<br>
But she baked it harder than the hobs of Hell.<p>

The foreman's name was John McCann<br>
By God, he was a blamed mean man<br>
Last week a premature blast went off<br>
And a mile in the air went big Jim Goff.<p>

And when next payday came around<br>
Jim Goff a dollar short was found<br>
When he asked, "What for?" came this reply<br>
"You were docked for the time you were up in the sky."
