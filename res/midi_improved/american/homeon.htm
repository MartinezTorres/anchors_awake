Oh, give me a home, where the buffalo roam<br>
Where the deer and the antelope play<br>
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word<br>
And the skies are not cloudy all day.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
Home, home on the range<br>
Where the deer and the antelope play<br>
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word<br>
And the skies are not cloudy all day.</i><p>

How often at night, when the heavens are bright<br>
With the light from the glittering stars<br>
I've stood there amazed, and asked, as I gazed,<br>
If their glory exceeds that of ours.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

The air is so pure, and the zephyrs so free<br>
And the breezes so balmy and light<br>
I would not exchange my home on the range<br>
For all the cities so bright.<p>

<i>Chorus</i>
